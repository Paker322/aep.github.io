                        <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                        <p>Despite the immense potential of VR applications, their development is hindered by the rapid pace of technological advancements, resulting in high project costs and difficulties in positioning VR within advertising.</p>
                        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
                        <p>In response to these challenges, the proposed solution aims to streamline the process of VR advertising for developers through the introduction of an innovative plugin. This plugin is designed to empower developers to effortlessly integrate advertisements within VR environments, providing a user-friendly and efficient solution to a historically complex problem. By simplifying the ad integration process, the goal is to enable developers to capitalize on the potential of VR advertising, ultimately helping them generate revenue in a field where income generation has traditionally been a formidable hurdle.</p>
                        <h3>Used Technologies</h3>
                        <p>Unity, NodeJS, MongoDB, JavaScript, FireBase, VueJS</p>
                        <h3>Implementation</h3> 
                        <p>The chosen Back-End development platform is Node.js, offering a versatile JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution. Node.js, renowned for its non-blocking architecture, serves as an ideal choice for resource-efficient applications, aided by the Node Package Manager (NPM) for accelerated development.</p>
                        <img src="images/vrCode.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
                        <p>To empower Back-End functionality, Express.js was integrated within Node.js. Express.js streamlines web server operations, automating tasks such as routing, data analysis, and security management. Middleware in Express.js effectively handled request and response processing, promoting error handling and parameter-based responses. JSON data processing was optimized through the use of Express.json(). Database connectivity was achieved via the Mongoose library, facilitating CRUD operations and data modeling.</p>
                        <p>For streamlined ad testing, the Postman application was employed to simplify API interactions. This technology stack ensures seamless communication from the Front-End to the database, bolstering the performance of the VR advertising platform.</p>
                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <img src="images/vrUnity.gif">
                        <p>In its final form, the project offers advertisers a means to publish their ads within the VR environment and enables developers to incorporate ads into their applications. Advertisers, logging into the system as stream users, can add their ad models through the interface and monitor the performance metrics, including views and clicks, for their ads. Additionally, developers have the capability to display ads provided by advertisers within VR applications through the dedicated plugin developed for this purpose.</p>
