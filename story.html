								<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
								<p>My journey into the world of tech started with a simple fascination for how computers work. What began as a childhood curiosity soon blossomed into a lifelong passion. I embarked on this incredible adventure, constantly pushing my boundaries and seeking new horizons.</p>
								<h3>Meeting With Full-Stack Development</h3>
								<p>During my time at university, I stumbled upon the fascinating world of full-stack development. Just like many students, I began my educational journey with a curiosity to learn, not fully realizing where it would take me.</p>
								<p>It was the projects in my internships that truly sparked my interest in full-stack development. As I immersed myself in these assignments, I found myself delving deeper into the source codes of various websites, excited to explore both the front-end and back-end intricacies. Designing user-friendly interfaces became a creative outlet, while crafting robust server-side solutions felt like solving intriguing puzzles.</p>
								<p>Now, as a full-stack developer, I reflect on my university years with immense gratitude. They served as the foundation that has brought me to where I am today, filled with unwavering enthusiasm. I'm constantly inspired by the fact that there's always more to learn, create, and countless lives to positively impact through technology.</p>
