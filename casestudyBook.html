                            responsive and user-friendly experience, enabling book catalog browsing, and reviews. The back end featured RESTful APIs, user authentication, and endpoints
                             for authors and sellers to manage their literary works. The database schema was meticulously structured to efficiently store user profiles, books, and reviews.
                            This approach resulted in the creation of a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform connecting book enthusiasts with a diverse range of books while offering authors 
                            and sellers a broader audience for their work.</p>
